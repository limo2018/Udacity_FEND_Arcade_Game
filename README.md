===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

## How To Play
- In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies.
- The player can use the Up, Down, Left and Right arrow keys to move around.
- Once the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square.
- Once the player reaches the water the game is won.
